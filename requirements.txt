Building the frontend UI for a Laravel 12 + Vue 3 (Options API) app styled with Tailwind CSS and built with Vite. The backend is already implemented. Your job is to redesign the existing interface and add new pages, components, and a navigation layout based on the specifications below.

This is a Pi-hole URL Manager application used for managing DNS and access control on a home network. The current UI is zombie-themed and needs to be replaced with a retro-futuristic terminal aesthetic. The new design should be professional, responsive, and accessible.

General Design and Technical Requirements

Use Vue 3 (Options API), not the Composition API or TypeScript.

Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

Maintain full WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance.

The design should be mobile-first, but also display well on desktop.

Use a dark retro-terminal theme: matte black background, greenish glowing text, subtle shadows, smooth hover transitions, and monospace fonts.

Theming Details

Aesthetic: Retro-futuristic, inspired by CRT terminals or “old computer” green phosphor displays.

Color Palette:

Background: #0a0a0a

Primary text: #00ff66

Secondary text: #9ef2a2

Accent: #14b866 (for interactive elements)

Error/warning: soft neon red or amber

Use subtle gradients, glows, and transitions to keep it polished.

Font: Monospace (JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, or Source Code Pro)

Accessibility:

Maintain high contrast.

Ensure all interactive elements have visible focus states.

Support keyboard navigation and ARIA labeling where appropriate.

App Structure

Create or update the following Vue components/pages:

1. Landing.vue

A simple landing page that introduces the app and explains its purpose.
This app is for personal or family use, designed to help manage networking and media tools hosted inside the home.

Content:

Headline: “Home Network Manager”

Description paragraph explaining that this app integrates with Pi-hole and other tools to manage access, filter content, and monitor home network usage.

A “Get Started” button linking to the Submit URL page.

Design:

Full-screen centered layout with large, glowing monospace text.

Optional animated typing effect or subtle background glow.

Use dark background with neon green text.

2. Manager.vue (Submit URL Page)

This page contains the form to submit URLs that temporarily disable Pi-hole DNS blocking.

Layout:

Title and short instruction text at the top.

URL input field (full width on mobile, medium width on desktop).

“Submit” button below.

Functionality:

Validate input as a proper URL.

Show success, loading, and error messages inline.

Messages should appear as terminal-like output text (green or red glow).

3. UrlList.vue (Table of URLs)

This page lists all URLs saved in the database.

Layout:

Table of URLs, with each row containing:

The URL

A trash icon button to delete it

Add a drag-and-drop area for users to drop URLs that should be “blocked” instead of submitted.

Design:

Responsive table (scrollable on small screens).

Subtle hover glow on table rows.

Drag-and-drop zone visually distinct with dashed green border and glowing background on hover.

4. ParentalControls.vue

A new page that allows parents to block social media platforms.

Layout:

Title: “Parental Controls”

Description: Short paragraph explaining that this feature temporarily blocks social media sites using Pi-hole or another backend API.

A dropdown <select> menu listing:

YouTube

Instagram

Facebook

Snapchat

Telegram

A “Block” button below the dropdown.

Functionality:

On submit, show success or failure feedback (styled in terminal theme).

All interactions should feel consistent with the rest of the UI.

5. NavBar.vue or AppNav.vue

A navigation component shared across all pages.

Requirements:

Include links for:

Home (Landing)

Submit URL

URL List

Parental Controls

On mobile, convert to a hamburger or slide-out drawer.

Keep navigation fixed at the top or side (depending on layout).

Highlight the current page with a subtle neon glow or underline.

Responsive Layout Guidelines

Use Tailwind’s responsive grid and flex utilities.

On mobile: vertical stacking, large tap targets, collapsible menus.

On desktop: more horizontal space, balanced padding, readable spacing.

Test for consistent rendering in both modes.

Deliverables

Updated Manager.vue and UrlList.vue with new UI and theme.

New pages: Landing.vue and ParentalControls.vue.

New shared navigation component (NavBar.vue or AppNav.vue).

Tailwind configuration updates (custom color variables and focus styles).

Accessibility-first styling (keyboard focus, ARIA labels, readable text).
