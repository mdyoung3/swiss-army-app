Additional Requirements for Laravel 12 App with Vue.js 3 Frontend

Please help implement the following features in a Laravel 12 application that uses Vue.js 3 on the frontend:

    New Drag-and-Drop URL Area on urllist Page

        Add a new Vue.js component to the urllist page.

        This component should allow users to drag and drop URLs into a defined section of the DOM (a visual drop zone).

        Once a URL is dropped into this area, it should be captured and stored (persisted).

    Database Storage

        Create a new database table (e.g., blocked_urls or disallowed_urls) to store these dropped URLs.

        Each entry should at least have: id, url, created_at, and updated_at.

    Validation on Home Page Submit

        On the home page, when a user submits a URL (existing form submission flow), the backend should:

            Check if the submitted URL exists in the newly created blocked_urls table.

            If a match is found, return a validation response or message indicating “This URL is not permitted.”

            Prevent the submission from proceeding.

Please use the Vue Options API with regular JavaScript, not the Composition API or TypeScript.

Let me know if you need the existing context or want this integrated into the current app structure.
